# CryptoAlgs
I took a cryptography class in the spring quarter of 2016, and to solve various problems we were given multiple Java applets on the course website. However they were annoying to use and lacked funcitonality. This repo is a collection of programs I created as a workaround to the applets. Included are Java implementations of Caesar shift, Vigenere shift, Playfair cipher, and Hill cipher.
